## 📖 Overview

This project is an in-depth review and reinterpretation of the survey paper:
**Yu, R., Chen, S., Xie, Y., & Jia, X. (2025).**
*A Survey of Foundation Models for Environmental Science.*
arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.03142

Foundation models are transforming the way we tackle planetary-scale challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, and disaster risk management. This short story explores the evolution of environmental modeling, six core application domains where foundation models excel, how these models are developed, and key limitations and reflections on their future.

## 🧪 What This Project Covers

**Foundation Model Applications**

* Forward Prediction (e.g., ClimaX, Pangu-Weather)
* Data Generation (e.g., DiffusionSat)
* Data Assimilation (in-context learning for adaptive updates)
* Downscaling (improving spatial resolution of coarse models)
* Model Ensembling (combining physical and learned models)
* Decision-Making (human-in-the-loop AI for policy)

**How Foundation Models Are Built**

* Data Collection & Harmonization
* Model Architecture Design (e.g., multi-modal transformers)
* Self-Supervised Training with physics-aware loss functions
* Tuning for specific regions/tasks via fine-tuning and prompts
* Evaluation via robustness, generalization, and physical plausibility

**Open Challenges**

* Model Explainability and Trust
* Computational Cost Barriers
* Handling Rare/Extreme Environmental Events
* Ensuring Scientific Validity (Physical Consistency)

## 🗣️ Reflections

> “Foundation models aren't just tools — they're becoming co-pilots in understanding the Earth.”

In my reflections, I emphasized the importance of data democratization, physics-aware modeling, and open accessibility of environmental AI systems for global impact.

## 📝 How to Reproduce

This repository is documentation-focused. There is no executable code, but to reproduce the assignment:

1. Read the referenced paper thoroughly.
2. Rewrite the paper’s concepts in your own words (as demonstrated in the Medium article).
3. Build a Google Slides deck based on the key ideas.
4. Record a 15–25 minute walkthrough explaining each slide and insight.
5. Publish the article and video, and organize everything clearly in a GitHub repo.
